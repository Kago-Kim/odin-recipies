    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>This creamy dill potato salad is the one my mother made for me as a boy growing up in Spanish Fort, Alabama. I know you will enjoy it! The best flavor is achieved when the salad is covered and placed in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 unpeeled red potatoes</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5 hard-boiled eggs, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot, cover them with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are cooked through but still firm, about 20 minutes. Remove from the water, let cool, and cut potatoes into chunks. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir sour cream, mayonnaise, onion, celery, vinegar, mustard, celery salt, and salt and pepper together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes and eggs in a large salad bowl; sprinkle with dried dill. Pour dressing over potatoes and eggs; mix lightly.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the salad for at least 30 minutes. Serve cold.</li>
    </ol>
